# Machine Learning Projects

## Overview

This repository contains machine learning projects I've conducted during the process ML exploration. Most of the projects also contain detailed reports that discuss the rationale behind the projects, methodology used and discussion/evaluation of the achieved results with further suggestions on ways of improvement. The notebook files used are also organised is a sequential step-by-step manner making them easy to follow and understand.

All the required data for the projects are available in the links contanined within the Jupyter Notebooks or folder paths.

Every project followed the standard protocol of machine learning projects including:

1. Data Processing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Training and Evaluation
5. Discussion on Results

## Project List

### [Pizza Classifier](./pizza-classifier/)

In this project, a CNN was trained to classify between images of pizza and non-pizza using the pretrained ResNet101 as a backbone. Detailed step-by-step instructions are provided on how to execute the project. In the second step of the project, a more complex CNN architecture was implemented and yielded an improved +5% gain over the initial trained model. The results are discussed at the end of the project.

### [Human Activity Clustering](./human-activity-clustering/)

In this project, we build and evaluate unsupervised machine learning models using the UCI Human Activity
Recognition dataset. The models are first evaluated without dimensionality reduction on the dataset and subsequently, newer iterations of the models are fitted after applying dimensionality reduction. The project intricately details the dataset, preprocessing, methods used to find optimal parameters for the models, impact of dimensionality reduction on the clustering process and a comparative study between the models.

### [Bank Campaign Prediction](./bank-campaign/)

In this project, we build and evaluate two supervised machine learning models designed predict whether the customer of a bank would accept a fixed term deposit. The project intricately details the criteria employed for feature selection, data preprocessing and provides a comprehensive analysis of the performance metrics associated with the selected machine learning models. As a culminating highlight, the model compares and discusses the performance of the selected machine learning models.

### [Flight Price Prediction](./flight-price-prediction/)

This project addresses the challenge faced by users in selecting the most optimal flight from a plethora of options available on various airline websites. The abundance of flight information can overwhelm users, leading to suboptimal choices and time inefficiency. The primary objective is to streamline this process by integrating data from flight websites, conducting comprehensive data processing, and employing exploratory data analysis techniques.
